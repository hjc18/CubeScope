# CubeScope

CubeScope is a small browser-based tool for viewing cubic voxel data.  
It consists of a single HTML file that uses `Three.js` and requires no build step.

## Features

- Orbit-style camera controls  
- Three orthogonal planes that can be moved along X, Y, Z  
- Click a region to display only the selected octant  
- Optional color mapping: choose the color that represents the maximum value

## Getting started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hjc18/CubeScope.git
cd CubeScope
# open the file in a browser
open index.html        # macOS
# or double-click the file on Windows / Linux
```
